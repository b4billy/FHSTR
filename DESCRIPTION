Description: This package currently provides data from the 2022 Beijing Olympics from NBC's API. The name of this package comes from the Olympic Motto: "Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together". This package is still a work in progress and new functions will hopefully be added soon! This package will likely be updated to include Paris 2024 Data when that event comes around.
